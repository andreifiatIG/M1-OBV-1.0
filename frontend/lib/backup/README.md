# API Client Backup

This directory contains the original API client and auto-save system before ElectricSQL migration.

## Files:
- `api-client-original.ts` - Original REST API client with Clerk authentication
- `autoSaveManager-original.ts` - Original sophisticated auto-save system

## Purpose:
These files are preserved as backup in case we need to:
1. Rollback ElectricSQL implementation
2. Reference original implementation patterns
3. Maintain hybrid approach during transition

## Migration Date:
Started: $(date)

## Notes:
The original system had excellent features:
- Sophisticated auto-save with debouncing
- Offline detection and graceful degradation
- Field-level progress tracking
- Local storage backup
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
